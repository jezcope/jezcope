ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jez Cope. I'm moving away from using GitHub as a a primary host for stuff and only using it to collaborate with folks who are on here. You may find that my repositories on here are out of date, and I'm aiming to standardise on only having projects mirrored here where necessary while cleaning up the rest.

You can find me elsewhere by checking out the links at the bottom of https://erambler.co.uk/about/

<!---
jezcope/jezcope is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
